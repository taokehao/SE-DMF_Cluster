# SE-DMF_Cluster

1. The energy barriers for the 23 raw data computed in this work are given in the Barrier.xlsx.
2. The data folder is where the unsupervised model outputs part of the data for subsequent plotting and data processing.
3. feature.csv is the feature of 308 structures obtained according to our designed descriptor.
4. kmeans.py and model.py are python codes for the kmeans algorithm and the hierarchical clustering algorithm.You can run them after downloading the project.
5. material-name.txt corresponds to what is the structure of each line of features in feature.csv
